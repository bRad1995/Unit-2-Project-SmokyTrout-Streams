The application is a full CRUD application with seven RESTFUL Routes that allow the user to: create, delete, edit, and update streams. MongoDB provides the database structure for all information pertaining to the streams. 




Future Enhancements:

Administrative features will be added to the: Add, Edit and Delete functions. An "About" page will be added to provide transparency about site's goals and intentions to assist anglers looking to explore the park. A "Bases of Opertaions" page will also be added to provide locations and information for shops and outfitters within the area that can provide further assitance to the users, if needed.
